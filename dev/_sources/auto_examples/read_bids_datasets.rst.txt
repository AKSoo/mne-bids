======================
01. Read BIDS datasets
======================

When working with electrophysiological data in the BIDS format, we usually have
varying data types, which can be loaded via the ``read_raw_bids`` function.

- MEG
- EEG (scalp electrodes)
- iEEG (ECoG and SEEG)
- the anatomical MRI scan of a study participant

In this tutorial, we show how ``read_raw_bids`` can be used to load and
inspect BIDS-formatted data.

Imports
-------
We are importing everything we need for this example:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-33

.. code-block:: default

    from mne.datasets import somato

    from mne_bids import BIDSPath, read_raw_bids, print_dir_tree, make_report








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-38

We will be using the `MNE somato data <mne_somato_data_>`_, which
is already stored in BIDS format.
For more information, you can check out the
respective :ref:`example <ex-convert-mne-sample>`.

Download the ``somato`` BIDS dataset
------------------------------------

Download the data if it hasn't been downloaded already, and return the path
to the download directory. This directory is the so-called `root` of this
BIDS dataset.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-48

.. code-block:: default

We can use MNE-BIDS to print a tree of all
included files and folders. We pass the ``max_depth`` parameter to
`mne_bids.print_dir_tree` to the output to three levels of folders, for
better readability in this example.

    The MNE-somato-data-bids dataset was created with BIDS version 1.2.0 by Lauri
    Parkkonen. This report was generated with MNE-BIDS
    (https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01896). The dataset consists of 1 participants
    (comprised of 1 men and 0 women; handedness were all unknown; ages all unknown).
    Data was recorded using a MEG system (Elekta manufacturer) sampled at 300.31 Hz
    with line noise at 50 Hz. There was 1 scan in total. Recording durations ranged
    from 897.08 to 897.08 seconds (mean = 897.08, std = 0.0), for a total of 897.08
    seconds of data recorded over all scans. For each dataset, there were on average
    316.0 (std = 0.0) recording channels per scan, out of which 316.0 (std = 0.0)
    were used in analysis (0.0 +/- 0.0 were removed from analysis).

Now it's time to get ready for reading some of the data! First, we need to
create a `mne_bids.BIDSPath`, which is the working horse object of MNE-BIDS
when it comes to file and folder operations.

For now, we're interested only in the MEG data in the BIDS root directory
of the ``somato`` dataset.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-76

.. code-block:: default


    datatype = 'meg'
    bids_path = BIDSPath(root=bids_root, datatype=datatype)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-78

We can now retrieve a list of all MEG-related files in the dataset:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-81

.. code-block:: default


    print(bids_path.match())

    root: /home/circleci/mne_data/MNE-somato-data

    datatype: meg
    basename: sub-01_task-somato_meg.fif)]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-99

The returned list contains ``BIDSpaths`` of 3 files:
``sub-01_task-somato_channels.tsv``, ``sub-01_task-somato_events.tsv``, and
``sub-01_task-somato_meg.fif``.
The first two are so-called sidecar files that contain information on the
recording channels and experimental events, and the third one is the actual
MEG data file.

Prepare reading the data
------------------------

There is obviously only one subject (``01``) and one experimental task
(``somato``). Let's use this knowledge to create a new ``BIDSPath`` with
all the information required to actually read the MEG data. We also need to
pass a ``suffix``, which is the last part of the filename just before the
extension -- ``'channels'`` and ``'events'`` for the two TSV files in
our example, and ``'meg'`` for MEG raw data. For MEG and EEG raw data, the
suffix is identical to the datatype, so don't let yourselve be confused here!

You probably noticed two things: Firstly, this looks like an ordinary string
now, not like the more-or-less neatly formatted output we saw before. And
secondly, that there's suddenly a filename extension which we never specified
anywhere!

The reason is that when you call ``print(bids_path)``, ``BIDSPath`` returns
a string representation of ``BIDSPath.fpath``, which looks different. If,
instead, you simply typed ``bids_path`` (or ``print(repr(bids_path))``, which
is the same) into your Python console, you would get the nicely formatted
output:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 125-128

.. code-block:: default


    bids_path





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    datatype: meg
    basename: sub-01_task-somato_meg)



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 129-147

The ``root`` here is âÂ you guessed it â the directory we passed via the
``root`` parameter: the "home" of our BIDS dataset. The ``datatype``, again,
is self-explanatory. The ``basename``, on the other hand, is created
automatically based on the suffix and **BIDS entities**  we passed to
``BIDSPath``: in our case, ``subject`` and ``task``.

.. note::
  There are many more supported entities, the most-commonly used among them
  probably being ``session``. Please see
  :ref:`our introduction to BIDSPath <bidspath-example>` to learn more
  about entities, ``basename``, and ``BIDSPath`` in general.

But what about that filename extension, now? ``BIDSPath.fpath``, which â
as you hopefully remember âÂ is invoked when you run ``print(bids_path)`` â
employs some heuristics to auto-detect some missing filename components.
Omitting the filename extension in your script can make your code
more portable. Note that, however, you **can** explicitly specify an
extension too, by passing e.g. ``extension='.fif'`` to ``BIDSPath``.
