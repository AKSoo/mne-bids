===================================
04. Convert EEG data to BIDS format
===================================

In this example, we use MNE-BIDS to create a BIDS-compatible directory of EEG
data. Specifically, we will follow these steps:

1. Download some EEG data from the
   `PhysioBank database <https://physionet.org/physiobank/database>`_.

2. Load the data, extract information, and save it in a new BIDS directory.

3. Check the result and compare it with the standard.

4. Cite ``mne-bids``.

Download the data
-----------------

First, we need some data to work with. We will use the
`EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset <https://doi.org/10.13026/C28G6P>`_
available on the PhysioBank database.

The data consists of 109 volunteers performing 14 experimental runs each.
For each subject, there were two baseline tasks (i) eyes open, (ii) eyes
closed, as well as four different motor imagery tasks.

In this example, we will download the data for a single subject doing the
baseline task "eyes closed" and format it to the Brain Imaging Data Structure
(`BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_).

Conveniently, there is already a data loading function available with
MNE-Python:

.. code-block:: default


    # Download the data for subject 1, for the 2 minutes of eyes closed rest task.
    # From the online documentation of the data we know that run "2" corresponds
    # to the "eyes closed" task.
    subject = 1
    run = 2
    eegbci.load_data(subject=subject, runs=run, update_path=True)

The data are in the `European Data Format <https://www.edfplus.info/>`_ with
the ``.edf`` extension, which is good for us because next to the
`BrainVision format`_, EDF is one of the recommended file formats for EEG
data in BIDS format.

However, apart from the data format, we need to build a directory structure
and supply meta data files to properly *bidsify* this data.

We will do exactly that in the next step.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 88-97

Convert to BIDS
---------------

Let's start with loading the data and extracting the events.
We are reading the data using MNE-Python's ``io`` module and the
:func:`mne.io.read_raw_edf` function.
Note that we must use the ``preload=False`` parameter, which is the default
in MNE-Python.
It prevents the data from being loaded and modified when converting to BIDS.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 97-103

.. code-block:: default


    # Load the data from "2 minutes eyes closed rest"
    edf_path = eegbci.load_data(subject=subject, runs=run)[0]
    raw = mne.io.read_raw_edf(edf_path, preload=False)
    raw.info['line_freq'] = 50  # specify power line frequency as required by BIDS

For the sake of the example we will also pretend that we have the electrode
coordinates for the data recordings.
We will use a coordinates file from the MNE testing data in `CapTrak`_
format.

.. note:: The ``*electrodes.tsv`` and ``*coordsystem.json`` files in BIDS are
          intended to carry information about digitized (i.e., *measured*)
          electrode positions on the scalp of the research subject. Do *not*
          (!) use these files to store "template" or "idealized" electrode
          positions, like those that can be obtained from
          :func:`mne.channels.make_standard_montage`!


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 116-133

.. code-block:: default


    # Get the electrode coordinates
    testing_data = mne.datasets.testing.data_path()
    captrak_path = op.join(testing_data, 'montage', 'captrak_coords.bvct')
    montage = mne.channels.read_dig_captrak(captrak_path)

    # Rename the montage channel names only for this example, because as said
    # before, coordinate and EEG data were not actually collected together
    # Do *not* do this for your own data.

With these steps, we have everything to start a new BIDS directory using
our data.

To do that, we can use :func:`write_raw_bids`

Generally, :func:`write_raw_bids` tries to extract as much
meta data as possible from the raw data and then formats it in a BIDS
compatible way. :func:`write_raw_bids` takes a bunch of inputs, most of
which are however optional. The required inputs are:

* :code:`raw`
* :code:`bids_basename`
* :code:`bids_root`

... as you can see in the docstring:

.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Save raw data to a BIDS-compliant folder structure.

        .. warning:: * The original file is simply copied over if the original
                       file format is BIDS-supported for that datatype. Otherwise,
                       this function will convert to a BIDS-supported file format
                       while warning the user. For EEG and iEEG data, conversion
                       will be to BrainVision format; for MEG, conversion will be
                       to FIFF.

                     * ``mne-bids`` will infer the manufacturer information
                       from the file extension. If your file format is non-standard
                       for the manufacturer, please update the manufacturer field
                       in the sidecars manually.

        Parameters
        ----------
        raw : mne.io.Raw
            The raw data. It must be an instance of `mne.io.Raw`. The data
            should not be loaded from disk, i.e., ``raw.preload`` must be
            ``False``.
        bids_path : mne_bids.BIDSPath
            The file to write. The `mne_bids.BIDSPath` instance passed here
            **must** have the ``.root`` attribute set. If the ``.datatype``
            attribute is not set, it will be inferred from the recording data type
            found in ``raw``.
            Example::

                bids_path = BIDSPath(subject='01', session='01', task='testing',
                                     acquisition='01', run='01', datatype='meg',
                                     root='/data/BIDS')

            This will write the following files in the correct subfolder ``root``::

                sub-01_ses-01_task-testing_acq-01_run-01_meg.fif
                sub-01_ses-01_task-testing_acq-01_run-01_meg.json
                sub-01_ses-01_task-testing_acq-01_run-01_channels.tsv
                sub-01_ses-01_acq-01_coordsystem.json

            and the following one if ``events_data`` is not ``None``::

                sub-01_ses-01_task-testing_acq-01_run-01_events.tsv

            and add a line to the following files::

                participants.tsv
                scans.tsv

            Note that the data type is automatically inferred from the raw
            object, as well as the extension. Data with MEG and other
            electrophysiology data in the same file will be stored as ``'meg'``.
        events_data : path-like | np.ndarray | None
            Use this parameter to specify events to write to the ``*_events.tsv``
            sidecar file, additionally to the object's `mne.Annotations` (which
            are always written).
            If a path, specifies the location of an MNE events file.
            If an array, the MNE events array (shape: ``(n_events, 3)``).
            If a path or an array and ``raw.annotations`` exist, the union of
            ``event_data`` and ``raw.annotations`` will be written.
            Corresponding descriptions for all event IDs (listed in the third
            column of the MNE events array) must be specified via the ``event_id``
            parameter; otherwise, an exception is raised.
            If ``None``, events will only be inferred from the the raw object's
            `mne.Annotations`.

            .. note::
               If ``not None``, writes the union of ``events_data`` and
               ``raw.annotations``. If you wish to **only** write
               ``raw.annotations``, pass ``events_data=None``. If you want to
               **exclude** the events in ``raw.annotations`` from being written,
               call ``raw.set_annotations(None)`` before invoking this function.

            .. note::
               Descriptions of all event IDs must be specified via the ``event_id``
               parameter.

        event_id : dict | None
            Descriptions of all event IDs, if you passed ``events_data``.
            The descriptions will be written to the ``trial_type`` column in
            ``*_events.tsv``. The dictionary keys correspond to the event
            descriptions and the values to the event IDs. You must specify a
            description for all event IDs in ``events_data``.
        anonymize : dict | None
            If `None` (default), no anonymization is performed.
            If a dictionary, data will be anonymized depending on the dictionary
            keys: ``daysback`` is a required key, ``keep_his`` is optional.

            ``daysback`` : int
                Number of days by which to move back the recording date in time.
                In studies with multiple subjects the relative recording date
                differences between subjects can be kept by using the same number
                of ``daysback`` for all subject anonymizations. ``daysback`` should
                be great enough to shift the date prior to 1925 to conform with
                BIDS anonymization rules.

            ``keep_his`` : bool
                If ``False`` (default), all subject information next to the
                recording date will be overwritten as well. If True, keep subject
                information apart from the recording date.

        format : 'auto' | 'BrainVision' | 'FIF'
            Controls the file format of the data after BIDS conversion. If
            ``'auto'``, MNE-BIDS will attempt to convert the input data to BIDS
            without a change of the original file format. A conversion to a
            different file format (BrainVision, or FIF) will only take place when
            the original file format lacks some necessary features. When a str is
            passed, a conversion can be forced to the BrainVision format for EEG,
            or the FIF format for MEG data.
        overwrite : bool
            Whether to overwrite existing files or data in files.
            Defaults to ``False``.

            If ``True``, any existing files with the same BIDS parameters
            will be overwritten with the exception of the ``*_participants.tsv``
            and ``*_scans.tsv`` files. For these files, parts of pre-existing data
            that match the current data will be replaced. For
            ``*_participants.tsv``, specifically, age, sex and hand fields will be
            overwritten, while any manually added fields in ``participants.json``
            and ``participants.tsv`` by a user will be retained.
            If ``False``, no existing data will be overwritten or
            replaced.
        verbose : bool
            If ``True``, this will print a snippet of the sidecar files. Otherwise,
            no content will be printed.

        Returns
        -------
        bids_path : mne_bids.BIDSPath
            The path of the created data file.

        Notes
        -----
        You should ensure that ``raw.info['subject_info']`` and
        ``raw.info['meas_date']`` are set to proper (not-``None``) values to allow
        for the correct computation of each participant's age when creating
        ``*_participants.tsv``.

        This function will convert existing `mne.Annotations` from
        ``raw.annotations`` to events. Additionally, any events supplied via
        ``events_data`` will be written too. To avoid writing of annotations,
        remove them from the raw file via ``raw.set_annotations(None)`` before
        invoking ``write_raw_bids``.

        To write events encoded in a ``STIM`` channel, you first need to create the
        events array manually and pass it to this function:

        ..
            events = mne.find_events(raw, min_duration=0.002)
            write_raw_bids(..., events_data=events)

        See the documentation of `mne.find_events` for more information on event
        extraction from ``STIM`` channels.

        When anonymizing ``.edf`` files, then the file format for EDF limits
        how far back we can set the recording date. Therefore, all anonymized
        EDF datasets will have an internal recording date of ``01-01-1985``,
        and the actual recording date will be stored in the ``scans.tsv``
        file's ``acq_time`` column.

We can see that MNE-BIDS wrote several important files related to subject 1
for us:

* ``electrodes.tsv`` containing the electrode coordinates and
  ``coordsystem.json``, which contains the metadata about the electrode
  coordinates.
* The actual EDF data file (now with a proper BIDS name) and an accompanying
  ``*_eeg.json`` file that contains metadata about the EEG recording.
* The ``*scans.json`` file lists all data recordings with their acquisition
  date. This file becomes more handy once there are multiple sessions and
  recordings to keep track of.
* And finally, ``channels.tsv`` and ``events.tsv`` which contain even further
  metadata.

Next to the subject specific files, MNE-BIDS also created several experiment
specific files. However, we will not go into detail for them in this example.

Cite mne-bids
-------------
After a lot of work was done by MNE-BIDS, it's fair to cite the software
when preparing a manuscript and/or a dataset publication.

We can see that the appropriate citations are already written in the
``README`` file.

If you are preparing a manuscript, please make sure to also cite MNE-BIDS
there.

Now it's time to manually check the BIDS directory and the meta files to add
all the information that MNE-BIDS could not infer. For instance, you must
describe EEGReference and EEGGround yourself. It's easy to find these by
searching for "n/a" in the sidecar files.

Remember that there is a convenient javascript tool to validate all your BIDS
directories called the "BIDS-validator", available as a web version and a
command line tool:
