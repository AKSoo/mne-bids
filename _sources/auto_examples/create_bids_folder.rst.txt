==========================================
Creating BIDS-compatible folders and files
==========================================

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) has standard conventions for file
names and folder hierarchy. MNE-BIDS comes with convenience functions if you
wish to create these files/folders on your own.

.. note::

   You may automatically convert Raw files to a BIDS-compatible folder with
   `raw_to_bids`. This example is for manually creating files/folders.

We'll import the relevant functions from the utils module



.. code-block:: python


    from mne_bids import make_bids_folders, make_bids_filename







Creating file names for BIDS
----------------------------

BIDS requires a specific ordering and structure for metadata fields in
file paths, the function `filename_bids` allows you to specify many such
pieces of metadata, ensuring that they are in the correct order in the
final file path. Omitted keys will not be included in the file path.



.. code-block:: python


    my_name = make_bids_filename(subject='test', session='two', task='mytask',
                                 suffix='data.csv')
    print(my_name)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    sub-test_ses-two_task-mytask_data.csv


You may also omit the suffix, which will result in *only* a prefix for a
file name. This could then prepended to many more files.



.. code-block:: python


    my_name = make_bids_filename(subject='test', task='mytask')
    print(my_name)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    sub-test_task-mytask


Creating folders
----------------

You can also use MNE-BIDS to create folder hierarchies.



.. code-block:: python


    path_folder = make_bids_folders('sub_01', session='mysession',
                                    kind='meg', root='path/to/project',
                                    make_dir=False)
    print(path_folder)

    # Note that passing `make_dir=True` will create the folder hierarchy, ignoring
    # errors if the folder already exists.




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    path/to/project/sub-sub_01/ses-mysession/meg
