This is a repository for experimental code for creating BIDS-compatible folders with MNE. 
All of this is considered as work-in-progress.

## How this works
Contributions are welcome in the form of pull requests. Once the implementation of a piece of
functionality is considered to be bug free and properly documented (both API docs and an example script),
it can be incorporated into the master branch.
